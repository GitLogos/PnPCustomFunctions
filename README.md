############# Credits to the PnP project for such an amazing tool ####### https://pnp.github.io/powershell/

The aim of this project is to create a "Swiss Army Knife" of commonly used functions with the PnP module for Powershell. At the moment it's based on Powershell 7 and PnP.Powershell 2.3.0 and only includes functions for common Sharepoint management.

I spent some time building some custom functions for work and I decided to share with people who may need them.

I'm a solo Dev without much experience so any feedback is appreciated. This is also my first project on Git-Hub

Thank you
